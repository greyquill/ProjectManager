# USER STORY CREATION GUIDELINES
# -----------------------------

STORY REQUIREMENTS:

Every User Story MUST follow this structure exactly:

1. User Story Statement
   FORMAT:
   "As a [specific user role], I want to [capability], so that [clear value/outcome]."

   Guidelines:
   - Be specific about the user role (avoid generic "user")
   - Reference personas when available: "As Dr. Sarah (Cardiologist)..."
   - Add context if helpful: "...working in a high-volume clinic..."
   - The "so that" clause must express clear business/user value
   - Avoid technical jargon in the story statement

2. Detailed Description
   - 1–3 paragraphs offering workflow clarity
   - Explain how this story fits into the larger system/Epic
   - Describe the current state vs. desired state
   - Include relevant context (user environment, typical scenarios)
   - Reference related stories if applicable

3. Preconditions
   - Required system state before story execution
   - Required user permissions or authentication
   - Required data or configuration
   - Example: "User must be logged in with 'Doctor' role"

4. Postconditions
   - What becomes true after successful completion
   - System state changes
   - Data persistence expectations
   - Audit log entries (if applicable)
   - Example: "Appointment record is saved in database with status 'Confirmed'"

5. Acceptance Criteria (MANDATORY GHERKIN FORMAT)
   Must include 3–8 testable conditions using:
   Given / When / Then / And / But

   Format:
   ```gherkin
   Scenario: [Descriptive scenario name]
     Given [initial context/state]
     And [additional context if needed]
     When [action/event occurs]
     Then [expected outcome]
     And [additional expected outcome]
   ```

   Requirements:
   - Each scenario must be independently testable
   - Cover the happy path first
   - Be specific with values and states
   - Avoid ambiguous terms

6. Negative / Edge Cases
   Must include at least 2–4 scenarios covering:
   - Error handling (invalid input, system errors)
   - Permission/authorization issues
   - Validation scenarios (field validation, business rule violations)
   - System resilience cases (timeout, network failure)
   - Boundary conditions (empty lists, maximum limits)
   - Race conditions or concurrency issues (if applicable)

   Format using Gherkin:
   ```gherkin
   Scenario: [Negative case description]
     Given [context]
     When [error condition occurs]
     Then [error is handled gracefully]
     And [user receives clear feedback]
   ```

7. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
   Include when relevant (specify "None" if truly not applicable):

   - **Performance**: Response times, throughput, load capacity
     * Example: "Page must load within 2 seconds under normal load"

   - **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data encryption, audit trails
     * Example: "All PHI must be encrypted at rest and in transit"

   - **Reliability**: Uptime expectations, error rates, failover
     * Example: "99.9% uptime during business hours"

   - **Scalability**: Concurrent users, data volume growth
     * Example: "Support 1000 concurrent users"

   - **Usability**: Accessibility (WCAG), mobile responsiveness, browser support
     * Example: "Must be WCAG 2.1 AA compliant"

   - **Auditability**: Logging, tracking, compliance reporting
     * Example: "All data changes must be logged with user ID and timestamp"

   - **Compliance**: Regulatory requirements (only if healthcare/regulatory domain)
     * Example: "Must comply with HIPAA privacy rules"

8. Business or Domain Rules
   - Mandatory if story touches workflows, finance, healthcare, compliance, etc.
   - State rules explicitly (don't assume they're obvious)
   - Include calculations, validations, constraints
   - Reference regulatory or policy requirements
   - Example: "Appointments can only be scheduled during clinic hours (8 AM - 6 PM)"
   - Example: "Patient age must be calculated from DOB, not entered manually"

9. Priority
   Use one of these frameworks:

   **MoSCoW Method:**
   - Must Have: Critical for release, non-negotiable
   - Should Have: Important but not critical
   - Could Have: Nice to have if time permits
   - Won't Have: Out of scope for this release

   **OR Priority Levels:**
   - P0 (Critical): Blocks release, security/data loss risk
   - P1 (High): Important for user experience or business value
   - P2 (Medium): Valuable but can wait for next release
   - P3 (Low): Nice to have, minimal impact if delayed

   Include brief justification for the priority level

10. Story Points / Effort Estimate
    Choose one estimation method:

    **Fibonacci Scale:** 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
    - 1-2: Simple, clear requirements, minimal risk
    - 3-5: Moderate complexity, some unknowns
    - 8-13: Complex, multiple components, higher risk
    - 21+: Epic-sized, needs to be broken down

    **OR T-Shirt Sizes:** XS, S, M, L, XL

    **OR** explicitly state: "Not estimated yet - requires technical spike"

    Include estimation assumptions if helpful

11. Dependencies
    - **Upstream**: What must be completed before this story can start?
      * Other stories, technical infrastructure, design work

    - **Downstream**: What stories are blocked by this?
      * Stories that build on this functionality

    - **External**: Third-party dependencies
      * API availability, vendor deliverables, legal approvals

    - **Technical**: Infrastructure or platform requirements
      * Database schema, authentication service, CI/CD pipeline

    State "None" if no dependencies exist

12. Definition of Done

## EPIC EXAMPLE (Healthcare Domain):

**Epic Title:** Epic: Streamlined Appointment Scheduling for Patients in Healthcare Portal

**Epic Summary:**
Enable patients to book, reschedule, and cancel appointments through a self-service portal, reducing administrative burden on staff and improving patient satisfaction. This Epic will deliver a fully integrated scheduling system that connects with existing EMR and calendar systems.

**Business Context:**
Currently, patients must call the clinic during business hours to schedule appointments, resulting in long wait times, missed calls, and scheduling errors. The clinic receives 200+ scheduling calls daily, consuming 15% of front desk staff time. Patient satisfaction scores for appointment scheduling are 3.2/5.

**Epic Objectives:**
- Reduce scheduling call volume by 60%
- Improve appointment booking time from 10 minutes to under 3 minutes

## STORY EXAMPLE (Healthcare Domain):

**User Story Statement:**
As a patient, I want to view available appointment slots filtered by provider and date, so that I can choose a convenient time that fits my schedule.

**Detailed Description:**
Patients often have preferences for specific providers and need to book appointments around work schedules. The current phone-based system requires back-and-forth communication to find mutually available times. This story enables patients to self-serve by viewing a calendar of available slots, filtered by their chosen provider and preferred date range. The system will integrate with the EMR to display real-time availability, preventing double-booking and ensuring accurate scheduling. This story is the foundation for the booking flow and must be completed before patients can actually book appointments.

**Preconditions:**
- Patient is logged into the healthcare portal with valid credentials
- Patient has "Active" status in the system
- At least one provider has available appointment slots in their schedule
- EMR integration is operational and returning schedule data

**Postconditions:**
- Patient has viewed available appointment slots
- No changes are made to provider schedules (read-only operation)
- User activity is logged for analytics (anonymized)
- Session timeout is reset (user remains active)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

```gherkin
Scenario: View available slots for a specific provider
  Given I am logged in as a patient
  And Dr. Smith has available slots on December 15, 2024
  When I select "Dr. Smith" from the provider dropdown
  And I select December 15, 2024 as the date
  Then I see a list of available time slots for Dr. Smith on that date
  And each slot shows the time (e.g., "10:00 AM - 10:30 AM")
  And each slot shows the appointment type (e.g., "Follow-up Visit")
  And slots are sorted chronologically

Scenario: Filter slots by specialty
  Given I am logged in as a patient
  When I select "Cardiology" from the specialty dropdown
  And I select "Next 7 days" as the date range
  Then I see all available slots for cardiologists in the next 7 days
  And results show provider name for each slot
  And results are grouped by date

Scenario: View slots with no provider preference
  Given I am logged in as a patient
  When I select "Any Provider" from the provider dropdown
  And I select December 15, 2024 as the date
  Then I see all available slots across all providers for that date
  And each slot clearly indicates which provider it belongs to

Scenario: Real-time availability updates
  Given I am viewing available slots for Dr. Smith on December 15
  When another patient books a slot at 2:00 PM
  And I refresh the view within 30 seconds
  Then the 2:00 PM slot is no longer displayed
  And the remaining slots are still shown accurately
```

**Negative / Edge Cases:**

```gherkin
Scenario: No available slots for selected criteria
  Given I am logged in as a patient
  When I select "Dr. Smith" from the provider dropdown
  And I select December 25, 2024 (a holiday)
  Then I see a message "No available slots found for the selected date"
  And I see a suggestion to "Try another date or provider"
  And the calendar highlights dates with availability

Scenario: EMR integration failure
  Given I am logged in as a patient
  When I attempt to view available slots
  And the EMR system is unavailable
  Then I see a message "Unable to load appointment availability. Please try again later."
  And I see a phone number to call for assistance
  And the error is logged for IT support

Scenario: Session timeout during viewing
  Given I am viewing available appointment slots
  When my session expires after 30 minutes of inactivity
  And I attempt to interact with the calendar
  Then I am redirected to the login page
  And I see a message "Your session has expired. Please log in again."
  And my previous selections are preserved after re-login

Scenario: Invalid date selection
  Given I am logged in as a patient
  When I attempt to select a date in the past
  Then the date picker prevents selection of past dates
  And only current and future dates are selectable
```

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

**Performance:**
- Page must load within 2 seconds under normal load (50 concurrent users)
- Appointment slot data must refresh within 1 second when filters change
- System must support 100 concurrent users viewing slots without degradation

**Security:**
- Only authenticated patients can view appointment slots
- Patients can only view slots for providers in their assigned clinic
- All API calls must use HTTPS encryption
- Session tokens must expire after 30 minutes of inactivity
- No PHI (Protected Health Information) logged in client-side browser console

**Usability:**
- Interface must be WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- Calendar must be fully navigable via keyboard
- Date picker must support screen readers
- Must work on mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- Must work on desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest 2 versions)

**Reliability:**
- System must gracefully handle EMR API timeouts (>5 seconds)
- If EMR is unavailable, display cached availability data (up to 5 minutes old) with warning message
- Implement retry logic for failed API calls (3 attempts with exponential backoff)

**Auditability:**
- Log all slot view requests with patient ID, timestamp, and selected filters
- Logs must not contain PHI in plain text
- Retain logs for 30 days for analytics and troubleshooting

**Business or Domain Rules:**
- Appointment slots are 30-minute increments by default
- Specialty-specific slots may have custom durations (e.g., 60 minutes for initial consults)
- Providers can block slots for administrative time (not visible to patients)
- Only slots at least 2 hours in the future are bookable (same-day restriction)
- Clinic hours are Monday-Friday 8:00 AM - 6:00 PM, Saturday 9:00 AM - 1:00 PM
- No appointments on Sundays or recognized holidays
- Patients cannot view slots for providers outside their assigned clinic location

**Priority:**
**Must Have (MoSCoW)** / **P0 (Critical)**

Justification: This is the foundational capability for the entire appointment booking Epic. Without the ability to view available slots, patients cannot proceed to book appointments. This story blocks all downstream booking, rescheduling, and cancellation stories.

**Story Points / Effort Estimate:**
**8 Story Points (Fibonacci)**

Estimation assumptions:
- EMR API integration adds complexity (3 points)
- Multiple filter combinations require extensive testing (2 points)
- Real-time availability refresh requires WebSocket or polling logic (2 points)
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop (1 point)
- Moderate risk due to EMR dependency

**Dependencies:**

**Upstream:**
- EMR API access granted and documented (BLOCKED - waiting on vendor)
- Portal authentication system must support role-based access (COMPLETE)
- Date picker UI component must be accessible (IN PROGRESS - Design Team)

**Downstream:**
- "Book Appointment" story (cannot proceed without this)
- "Reschedule Appointment" story (depends on slot availability logic)

**External:**
- EMR system uptime must be >99% (vendor SLA)
- EMR API rate limits: 1000 requests/minute (confirmed with vendor)

**Technical:**
- PostgreSQL database for caching appointment availability
- Redis for session management
- React frontend with date-fns library for date handling
