# =====================================================================
# ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA GUIDELINES & RULES FOR CURSOR
# Version: 1.0
# Last Updated: December 2024
# Applies when creating or reviewing acceptance criteria for Epics and User Stories.
# This rule set supersedes any conflicting acceptance criteria instructions.
# =====================================================================

# -------------------------
# OVERVIEW & PURPOSE
# -------------------------

## What are Acceptance Criteria?

Acceptance Criteria (AC) are specific conditions that must be satisfied for a user story or epic to be considered complete and accepted by the Product Owner or stakeholders. They serve as:

1. **Definition of Done**: Clear boundaries for when work is complete
2. **Testing Guidelines**: Basis for test case creation
3. **Scope Management**: Prevention of scope creep
4. **Communication Tool**: Shared understanding between team members
5. **Quality Gate**: Objective pass/fail decision criteria

## Why Good Acceptance Criteria Matter

- **Reduces Ambiguity**: Eliminates "I thought you meant..." conversations
- **Prevents Rework**: Clear requirements from the start
- **Enables Estimation**: Team can accurately estimate work
- **Facilitates Testing**: QA knows exactly what to test
- **Ensures Value**: Confirms user needs are met
- **Legal/Compliance**: Provides audit trail for regulatory requirements

---

# -------------------------
# CORE PRINCIPLES
# -------------------------

## The INVEST Criteria for Good Acceptance Criteria

Every set of acceptance criteria should be:

### I - Independent
- Can be tested without dependency on other stories (where possible)
- Does not create cascading failures if one criterion fails
- Each criterion stands alone as a testable condition

### N - Negotiable
- Written at appropriate level of detail (not too prescriptive on "how")
- Allows development team flexibility in implementation
- Focuses on "what" and "why" rather than "how"

### V - Valuable
- Directly tied to business or user value
- Addresses user needs or business objectives
- Not purely technical unless it's a technical story

### E - Estimable
- Clear enough that team can estimate effort
- All unknowns and assumptions are documented
- Team understands what "done" looks like

### S - Small (Specific)
- Focused on single piece of functionality
- Not too broad or encompassing
- Typically 3-8 criteria per story (more indicates story should be split)

### T - Testable
- Can be objectively verified (pass/fail)
- No ambiguous terms like "fast," "good," "user-friendly" without definition
- Includes measurable criteria where applicable

---

# -------------------------
# ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA FORMATS
# -------------------------

## Format 1: Gherkin (Given-When-Then) - RECOMMENDED

**When to Use:**
- User-facing features with clear workflows
- Features requiring behavior validation
- Stories with conditional logic
- Integration scenarios
- Most functional requirements

**Structure:**
```gherkin
Scenario: [Descriptive name of the scenario]
  Given [precondition/context]
  And [additional context if needed]
  When [action/trigger/event]
  And [additional actions if needed]
  Then [expected outcome/result]
  And [additional outcomes if needed]
  But [exception or negative condition]
```

**Benefits:**
- Universally understood format
- Maps directly to automated tests (Cucumber, SpecFlow)
- Forces clear thinking about context, action, and outcome
- Natural language readable by non-technical stakeholders
- Supports behavior-driven development (BDD)

**Example:**
```gherkin
Scenario: User successfully logs in with valid credentials
  Given the user is on the login page
  And the user has a valid account (username: test@example.com)
  When the user enters their username "test@example.com"
  And the user enters their password "SecurePass123!"
  And the user clicks the "Login" button
  Then the user is redirected to the dashboard page
  And the welcome message displays "Welcome back, John!"
  And the session cookie is set with 30-minute expiration
```

## Format 2: Checklist (Simple Bullet Points)

**When to Use:**
- Simple features with straightforward requirements
- Configuration or setup stories
- Technical debt stories
- Research/spike stories
- Stories where workflow is obvious

**Structure:**
```
Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Criterion 1 (specific, testable condition)
- [ ] Criterion 2 (specific, testable condition)
- [ ] Criterion 3 (specific, testable condition)
```

**Benefits:**
- Quick to write and read
- Good for non-complex stories
- Easy checklist for manual testing
- Straightforward for team to review

**Example:**
```
Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] User can select profile photo from device gallery
- [ ] Selected photo is displayed as circular avatar (200x200px)
- [ ] Photo is compressed to max 500KB before upload
- [ ] Success message appears after successful upload
- [ ] Avatar updates across all pages within 2 seconds
```

## Format 3: Scenario Outline (Data-Driven)

**When to Use:**
- Testing multiple input variations
- Validation rules with different data sets
- Boundary testing scenarios
- Permission-based access control

**Structure:**
```gherkin
Scenario Outline: [Template description]
  Given [precondition with <placeholder>]
  When [action with <placeholder>]
  Then [expected outcome with <placeholder>]

  Examples:
  | input_field | expected_result |
  | value1      | outcome1        |
  | value2      | outcome2        |
```

**Example:**
```gherkin
Scenario Outline: Password validation
  Given the user is on the registration page
  When the user enters password "<password>"
  Then the system displays "<message>"

  Examples:
  | password     | message                           |
  | abc          | Password must be at least 8 chars |
  | password     | Password must include a number    |
  | Pass123      | Password must include special char|
  | Pass@123     | Password accepted                 |
```

# -------------------------
# MANDATORY RULES FOR ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
# -------------------------

## Rule 1: EVERY User Story MUST Have Acceptance Criteria

**Why:** Without AC, there's no objective way to determine if a story is complete.

**Enforcement:**
- Stories without AC cannot be moved to "In Progress"
- Product Owner must review and approve AC before sprint planning
- AC must exist before story estimation

**Exception:**
- Research/Spike stories may have "Definition of Done" instead of traditional AC
- Technical debt stories may use checklist format with technical outcomes

## Rule 2: Acceptance Criteria MUST Be Written Before Development Starts

**Why:** Writing AC during development leads to confirmation bias and missed scenarios.

**Best Practice:**
- Write AC during backlog refinement
- Review AC in sprint planning
- Update AC only if requirements change (with PO approval)

## Rule 3: Use Gherkin Format for All Functional Requirements

**Why:** Gherkin provides structure, clarity, and maps to automated tests.

**Mandatory Elements:**
- Every functional AC must include Given-When-Then structure
- Avoid "And" chains longer than 2-3 items (creates new scenario instead)
- Use present tense ("user clicks" not "user clicked")

## Rule 4: Acceptance Criteria MUST Be Testable and Objective

**Why:** Subjective criteria lead to disputes and unclear definition of done.

**Bad Examples (Subjective):**
- ❌ "System should be fast"
- ❌ "UI should look good"
- ❌ "Error handling should be user-friendly"
- ❌ "Performance should be acceptable"

**Good Examples (Objective):**
- ✅ "Page loads within 2 seconds on 4G network"
- ✅ "UI matches approved Figma design (link: ...)"
- ✅ "Error message displays: 'Invalid email format. Example: user@domain.com'"
- ✅ "System handles 100 concurrent users without response time > 3 seconds"

## Rule 5: Each Scenario MUST Include Positive AND Negative Cases

**Why:** Most bugs occur in error handling and edge cases.

**Requirement:**
- Minimum 1 happy path scenario
- Minimum 2 negative/edge case scenarios per story
- Cover: invalid input, missing data, permission errors, system failures

**Example:**
```gherkin
# POSITIVE CASE
Scenario: Successfully create appointment
  Given doctor has available slots on Dec 15, 2024
  When patient selects 10:00 AM slot
  Then appointment is confirmed
  And confirmation email is sent

# NEGATIVE CASES
Scenario: Attempt to book unavailable slot
  Given the 10:00 AM slot is already booked
  When patient attempts to select that slot
  Then error message displays "This slot is no longer available"
  And alternative slots are suggested

Scenario: Attempt to book without login
  Given user is not logged in
  When user attempts to book appointment
  Then user is redirected to login page
  And message displays "Please log in to book appointments"
```

## Rule 6: Avoid Implementation Details (Focus on WHAT, not HOW)

**Why:** AC defines requirements, not design. Implementation is team's responsibility.

**Bad (Too Prescriptive):**
- ❌ "When user clicks button, make AJAX call to /api/users endpoint using POST method"
- ❌ "Store data in users table with columns: id, name, email"
- ❌ "Use React Context API for state management"

**Good (Outcome-Focused):**
- ✅ "When user clicks Save, data persists and user sees confirmation message"
- ✅ "User information is stored securely and retrievable on next login"
- ✅ "User preferences are available across all pages without page refresh"

**Exception:** AC may include technical details for:
- API contracts (when building integrations)
- Performance requirements (response times, throughput)
- Security requirements (encryption, authentication)
- Compliance requirements (audit logging, data retention)

## Rule 7: Quantify Whenever Possible

**Why:** Numbers eliminate ambiguity and enable objective testing.

**Apply to:**
- **Time:** "within 2 seconds", "after 30 minutes", "by EOD"
- **Quantity:** "at least 10 items", "maximum 500 characters", "exactly 3 retries"
- **Percentage:** "95% accuracy", "80% code coverage", "< 5% error rate"
- **Size:** "max 5MB file", "200x200 pixel image", "8-character minimum"
- **Frequency:** "once per day", "every 5 minutes", "on every page load"

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Search returns results within 1 second for 95% of queries"
- ✅ "Password must be 8-64 characters"
- ✅ "System sends reminder exactly 24 hours before appointment"
- ✅ "Dashboard displays data from last 30 days"

## Rule 8: Include System State in Given Clause

**Why:** Tests must be repeatable and isolated. Initial state matters.

**Required Context:**
- User authentication state (logged in, logged out, specific role)
- Data prerequisites (records exist, database state)
- System configuration (feature flags, settings)
- Time/date context (if relevant)
- External system state (APIs available, integrations active)

**Example:**
```gherkin
Scenario: View patient history
  Given the user is logged in as a "Doctor"
  And patient "John Doe" (ID: 12345) exists in the system
  And patient has 3 previous visits recorded
  And the EMR integration is active
  When doctor searches for patient "John Doe"
  Then patient history displays all 3 previous visits
  And visit dates are shown in reverse chronological order
```

## Rule 9: One Acceptance Criterion = One Testable Condition

**Why:** Each criterion should have clear pass/fail outcome.

**Bad (Multiple Conditions in One):**
- ❌ "User can login, view dashboard, and update profile"

**Good (Separated Concerns):**
- ✅ Scenario 1: User can login with valid credentials
- ✅ Scenario 2: User can view personalized dashboard after login
- ✅ Scenario 3: User can update profile information

**Guideline:** If you use "and" more than twice, split into separate scenarios.

## Rule 10: Acceptance Criteria MUST Align with User Story Statement

**Why:** AC validates the story's "I want" and "so that" clauses.

**User Story:**
```
As a patient, I want to view my upcoming appointments,
so that I can plan my schedule accordingly.
```

**AC Must Validate:**
- ✅ Patient can VIEW appointments (not create or cancel)
- ✅ Shows UPCOMING appointments (not past)
- ✅ Displays in a way that helps PLANNING (date, time, location, doctor)

**AC Should NOT Include (Scope Creep):**
- ❌ Ability to reschedule appointments (different story)
- ❌ Viewing appointment history (different story)
- ❌ Receiving appointment reminders (different story)

# -------------------------
# ADVANCED RULES & BEST PRACTICES
# -------------------------

## Rule 11: Include Non-Functional Requirements Where Relevant

**Categories:**

### Performance
```gherkin
Scenario: Dashboard loads quickly
  Given user has 1000 patient records
  When user navigates to dashboard
  Then page loads completely within 2 seconds
  And all charts render within 3 seconds
```

### Security
```gherkin
Scenario: Unauthorized access prevention
  Given user is not logged in
  When user attempts to access /patient-records URL directly
  Then user is redirected to login page
  And no patient data is displayed
  And attempt is logged in security audit trail
```

### Accessibility
```gherkin
Scenario: Screen reader compatibility
  Given user is using JAWS screen reader
  When user navigates to appointment form
  Then all form fields have proper labels
  And field requirements are announced
  And error messages are announced immediately
```

### Usability
```gherkin
Scenario: Mobile responsive design
  Given user is on mobile device (375px width)
  When user views appointment list
  Then appointments display in single column
  And all action buttons are tappable (min 44px height)
  And no horizontal scrolling is required
```

## Rule 12: Handle Concurrent Actions and Race Conditions

**Why:** Real systems have multiple simultaneous users.

**Example:**
```gherkin
Scenario: Prevent double-booking
  Given Doctor has one available slot at 10:00 AM
  And Patient A is viewing the slot
  And Patient B is also viewing the same slot
  When Patient A books the slot
  And Patient B attempts to book the same slot 2 seconds later
  Then Patient B sees error "Slot no longer available"
  And Patient B is shown alternative slots
  And only Patient A's booking is confirmed
```

## Rule 13: Define Expected Behavior for Async Operations

**Why:** Many operations are asynchronous and users need feedback.

**Example:**
```gherkin
Scenario: File upload with progress
  Given user selects a 50MB PDF file
  When user clicks "Upload"
  Then upload button displays "Uploading..." with spinner
  And upload button is disabled during upload
  And progress bar shows percentage complete
  When upload completes after ~30 seconds
  Then success message displays "File uploaded successfully"
  And file appears in documents list
  And upload button returns to enabled state
```

## Rule 14: Specify Data Validation Rules Explicitly

**Why:** Validation is a common source of bugs and user frustration.

**Format:**
```gherkin
Scenario Outline: Email validation
  Given user is on registration form
  When user enters email "<email>"
  And clicks "Next"
  Then validation result is "<result>"
  And message displays "<message>"

  Examples:
  | email              | result  | message                          |
  | valid@example.com  | Success | Email accepted                   |
  | invalid            | Error   | Please enter valid email         |
  | test@              | Error   | Please enter valid email         |
  | @example.com       | Error   | Please enter valid email         |
  | (empty)            | Error   | Email is required                |
  | test+tag@mail.com  | Success | Email accepted (plus addressing) |
```

## Rule 15: Define Audit and Logging Requirements

**Why:** Compliance and troubleshooting require audit trails.

**Example:**
```gherkin
Scenario: Audit trail for patient record access
  Given Dr. Smith is logged in
  When Dr. Smith views patient John Doe's record
  Then audit log records:
    | Field        | Value                      |
    | Action       | VIEW_PATIENT_RECORD        |
    | User         | dr.smith@hospital.com      |
    | Patient      | John Doe (ID: 12345)       |
    | Timestamp    | 2024-12-11 14:30:25 UTC    |
    | IP Address   | 192.168.1.100              |
  And audit log is immutable (cannot be deleted/modified)
  And audit log is retained for 7 years
```

## Rule 16: Specify Integration Behavior

**Why:** Integration failures are common and must be handled gracefully.

**Example:**
```gherkin
Scenario: Payment gateway timeout
  Given user has entered payment information
  And payment gateway typically responds in 2 seconds
  When user clicks "Pay Now"
  And payment gateway does not respond within 10 seconds
  Then user sees message "Payment processing is taking longer than usual"
  And system retries payment request (max 3 attempts)
  And if all retries fail, user sees "Payment failed. Please try again."
  And user's payment information is not charged
  And failed attempt is logged for investigation
```

## Rule 17: Define Internationalization (i18n) Requirements

**Why:** Global applications must work across languages and locales.

**Example:**
```gherkin
Scenario: Display content in user's preferred language
  Given user's browser language is set to "Spanish"
  When user visits the homepage
  Then all text displays in Spanish
  And date format follows Spanish convention (DD/MM/YYYY)
  And currency displays as EUR with appropriate symbol
  And numbers use comma as decimal separator

Scenario: Language switching
  Given user is viewing page in English
  When user selects "Español" from language dropdown
  Then page content updates to Spanish immediately
  And user preference is saved for future visits
  And URL parameter reflects language: ?lang=es
```

# -------------------------
# COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
# -------------------------

## Mistake 1: Vague or Ambiguous Language

**Bad:**
- ❌ "System should be user-friendly"
- ❌ "App should be fast"
- ❌ "Error handling should be good"
- ❌ "Interface should be intuitive"

**Good:**
- ✅ "New users complete first task without help documentation in <5 minutes"
- ✅ "Page load time <2 seconds on 4G network (95th percentile)"
- ✅ "Error messages display specific problem and resolution steps"
- ✅ "90% of users complete checkout in ≤3 clicks"

## Mistake 2: Too Many Acceptance Criteria

**Problem:** Story probably too large or complex

**Solution:**
- If >8 acceptance criteria, consider splitting the story
- Each story should deliver one coherent piece of value
- Look for natural boundaries to split

**Example of Story Needing Split:**
```
Original Story: User Registration (15 criteria)

Split into:
- Story 1: Basic Registration (5 criteria)
- Story 2: Email Verification (3 criteria)
- Story 3: Profile Completion (4 criteria)
- Story 4: Welcome Email (3 criteria)
```

## Mistake 3: Mixing Different Abstraction Levels

**Bad:**
```gherkin
Scenario: User registration
  Given user is on registration page
  When user enters email in input field with id="email-input"  ← Too specific
  And user enters password
  Then user account is created in users table  ← Too technical
  And welcome screen appears  ← Right level
```

**Good:**
```gherkin
Scenario: User registration
  Given user is on registration page
  When user enters valid email address
  And user enters secure password
  Then user account is created successfully
  And welcome screen displays with user's name
  And confirmation email is sent to user's email
```

## Mistake 4: Missing Cleanup or State Reset

**Bad:**
```gherkin
Scenario: Create appointment
  When doctor creates appointment for 10:00 AM
  Then appointment appears in calendar
  # ❌ What happens to this test data?
```

**Good:**
```gherkin
Scenario: Create appointment
  Given test database is in clean state
  When doctor creates appointment for 10:00 AM
  Then appointment appears in calendar with ID [appointment_id]
  And appointment can be retrieved by ID
  # Cleanup handled by test framework teardown
```

## Mistake 5: Forgetting Edge Cases

**Checklist of Common Edge Cases:**
- [ ] Empty input (null, empty string, empty array)
- [ ] Maximum limits (character count, file size, number of items)
- [ ] Minimum limits (below threshold values)
- [ ] Special characters (unicode, emojis, SQL injection attempts)
- [ ] Boundary values (exactly at min/max, one above/below)
- [ ] Concurrent actions (two users doing same thing)
- [ ] Network failures (timeout, disconnect, retry)
- [ ] Permission boundaries (unauthorized access attempts)
- [ ] State transitions (invalid state changes)
- [ ] Time-based (timezone differences, DST, expired sessions)

## Mistake 6: Not Involving QA in AC Creation

**Why It's a Mistake:**
- QA has expertise in edge cases and test scenarios
- AC will be used to create test cases
- Early QA involvement catches issues before development

**Best Practice:**
- Include QA in backlog refinement sessions
- QA reviews and suggests additional AC
- QA identifies testability concerns early

## Mistake 7: Writing AC After Development Starts

**Problems:**
- Confirmation bias (AC written to match what's already built)
- Missed requirements
- Scope disputes
- Rework and delays

**Solution:**
- AC must be complete before sprint planning
- Development cannot start until AC is approved by PO
- Any AC changes during sprint require PO approval and may impact sprint commitment

# -------------------------
# EPIC-LEVEL ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
# -------------------------

## How Epic AC Differs from Story AC

**Story AC:** Detailed, scenario-based, immediate functionality
**Epic AC:** High-level, outcome-based, business value

## Rules for Epic Acceptance Criteria

### Rule E1: Focus on Business Outcomes, Not Features

**Bad (Feature-Focused):**
- ❌ "Appointment scheduling module is built"
- ❌ "Patient portal is deployed"

**Good (Outcome-Focused):**
- ✅ "Patients can book appointments online 24/7"
- ✅ "60% reduction in phone calls for scheduling"
- ✅ "No-show rate decreases from 18% to <5%"

### Rule E2: Epic AC Should Be Measurable

**Format:**
```
Epic Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] [Metric] reaches [target value] within [timeframe]
- [ ] [Percentage] of [user group] can [capability] without [assistance]
- [ ] [Business metric] improves from [baseline] to [target]
```

**Example:**
```
Epic: Online Appointment Scheduling

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] 80% of patients can book appointments without calling clinic
- [ ] Average appointment booking time reduces from 10min to <3min
- [ ] No-show rate decreases by 25% within 60 days of launch
- [ ] System handles 100 concurrent booking requests
- [ ] Patient satisfaction score for scheduling increases to 4.5/5
- [ ] 90% of bookings completed without staff intervention
```

### Rule E3: Include Success Metrics and KPIs

**Categories:**

**User Adoption:**
- X% of target users actively using feature
- Y number of transactions per day/week
- Z% feature utilization rate

**Business Impact:**
- Revenue increase/cost reduction
- Process efficiency gains
- Customer satisfaction improvement

**Technical Quality:**
- System performance benchmarks
- Uptime/reliability targets
- Security/compliance standards

**Example:**
```
Epic: Revenue Cycle Management Optimization

Acceptance Criteria:

User Adoption:
- [ ] 95% of claims submitted through automated system
- [ ] 90% of billing staff trained and using new workflow

Business Impact:
- [ ] Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) reduced from 45 to <25 days
- [ ] Claim denial rate reduced from 12% to <5%
- [ ] $140K+ annual revenue recapture from improved billing

```

### Rule E4: Epic AC Must Be Achievable Within Epic Timeframe

**Bad (Unrealistic):**
- ❌ "Become #1 healthcare platform globally" (for 6-month epic)
- ❌ "100% patient adoption" (unlikely in any timeframe)

**Good (Realistic):**
- ✅ "Achieve 60% patient adoption within 90 days post-launch"
- ✅ "Top 3 healthcare platform in target market by user reviews"

### Rule E5: Link Epic AC to Strategic Objectives

**Format:**
```
Epic AC should answer:
- How does this epic advance company strategy?
- What business problem does it solve?
- What happens if we DON'T do this epic?
```

**Example:**
```
Epic: AI-Powered Clinical Documentation

Strategic Alignment:
- Supports strategic goal: "Reduce clinician burnout"
- Addresses problem: "Doctors spend 2+ hours on charts after hours"
- Risk if not done: "Lose competitive advantage; physician retention issues"

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] 70% reduction in documentation time per encounter
- [ ] Physician satisfaction with documentation increases from 2.8 to 4.2/5
- [ ] 95% accuracy rate for AI-generated clinical notes
- [ ] Zero HIPAA violations from AI system in first 90 days
- [ ] 3+ additional patients seen per doctor per day
- [ ] ROI positive within 6 months (cost savings > implementation cost)
```

- [ ] Aligns with epic objectives (if part of epic)

### Format Check
- [ ] Uses approved format (Gherkin recommended for functional)
- [ ] Follows team's naming conventions
- [ ] Proper Given-When-Then structure
- [ ] Scenarios have descriptive names

### Collaboration Check
- [ ] Product Owner reviewed and approved

# AI AGENT INSTRUCTIONS
# -------------------------

## When AI is asked to create or review Acceptance Criteria:

### MUST DO:
1. **Always use Gherkin format** for functional requirements unless explicitly asked otherwise
2. **Include minimum 3 scenarios**: 1 happy path, 2+ negative/edge cases
3. **Quantify everything**: Replace vague terms with specific metrics
4. **Verify testability**: Every AC must have objective pass/fail criteria
5. **Check alignment**: Ensure AC matches the user story statement
6. **Include Given clause**: Always specify initial system state
7. **Add non-functional requirements**: Performance, security, accessibility where relevant
8. **Use scenario outlines**: For validation rules with multiple input variations
9. **Consider edge cases**: Empty input, max limits, concurrent actions, timeouts
10. **Format properly**: Use code blocks for Gherkin, checkboxes for lists

### NEVER DO:
1. **Never use ambiguous terms** without definition (fast, good, user-friendly)
2. **Never skip negative scenarios** - they catch most bugs
3. **Never prescribe implementation** - this is the responsibility of the development team
